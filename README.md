# Happiness-story
This project intends to explore the state of “happiness” around the world.

The project is based on the “World Happiness Report 2019”, the seventh such report written
by a group of independent experts acting in their personal capacities. The data is extracted from the
Gallup World Poll that annually asks individuals to rank certain qualities of life in their countries on a
scale of 1 to 10. The countries are then benchmarked against a hypothetical country called “Dystopia”,
an imaginary country that has the world’s least-happy people based on receiving the lowest scores
observed in each of the key variables being measured. At the other end of the scale is Utopia, also a
non-existent country that achieves the highest scores in each category. Every country falls somewhere
in between.

Using parameters and calculated fields, a radial bar graph was created. (Fourth slide in the happiness story)
